# Neural-Style-Transfer

1) Implementing the VGG neural network from scratch in Pytorch, Keras or Tensorflow.  

2) Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
